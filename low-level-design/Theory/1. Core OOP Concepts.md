## OOP Concepts with examples

- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation


### Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class (called a child class or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent class or superclass). This promotes code reuse and enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

#### Parent Class

- The class whose properties and methods are inherited.
- Also known as the base or superclass.

#### Child Class

- The class that inherits from the parent class.
- Can override or extend the functionality of the parent class.

#### Types of Inheritance
- Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits from one parent class.
- Multiple Inheritance: A subclass inherits from more than one parent class.
- Multilevel Inheritance: A subclass inherits from a parent class, which itself inherits from another class.
- Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple subclasses inherit from a single parent class.
- Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of multiple inheritance types.

#### Single Inheritance

```
# Parent Class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound."

# Child Class
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} barks."

```

#### Multiple Inheritance

```
class Flyable:
    def fly(self):
        return "This animal can fly."

# Parent Class 2
class Swimable:
    def swim(self):
        return "This animal can swim."

# Child Class
class Duck(Flyable, Swimable):
    def quack(self):
        return "Duck quacks."
```

#### Multilevel Inheritance

```
# Parent Class
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal makes a sound."

# Intermediate Class
class Mammal(Animal):
    def has_fur(self):
        return True

# Child Class
class Dog(Mammal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Dog barks."
```


#### Hierarchial Inheritance

```
# Parent Class
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal makes a sound."

# Child Class 1
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Dog barks."

# Child Class 2
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Cat meows.
```

#### Hybrid Inheritance

```
# Parent Class
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal makes a sound."

# Intermediate Class 1
class Flyable(Animal):
    def fly(self):
        return "This animal can fly."

# Intermediate Class 2
class Swimable(Animal):
    def swim(self):
        return "This animal can swim."

# Child Class
class Duck(Flyable, Swimable):
    def quack(self):
        return "Duck quacks."
```

### Abstraction

Abstraction refers to the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. The goal is to reduce complexity and make the system easier to use.

#### Abstract Class

- A class that cannot be instantiated directly.
- It can have abstract methods (methods without implementation) as well as concrete methods (methods with implementation).
- Used to define a blueprint for derived classes.
- If a subclass does not implement all the abstract methods, it will also become an abstract class.

#### Abstract Method

- A method declared in an abstract class, but without any implementation.
- Must be implemented in all subclasses of the abstract class.

#### Example

```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract Class
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        """Calculate the area of the shape."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        """Calculate the perimeter of the shape."""
        pass

# Concrete Class
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

# Concrete Class
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius

```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Python, polymorphism refers to the ability of different object types to respond to the same method call in their own way.

#### Key Concepts of Polymorphism

- Method Overriding:<br>
A child class can provide its own implementation of a method defined in the parent class.
<br>
- Duck Typing:<br>
In Python, if an object has the required method, it can be called, regardless of its class. This is a dynamic form of polymorphism.
<br>
- Operator Overloading:<br>
Same operator performs different operations depending on the types of operands.
<br>
- Function/Method Polymorphism:<br>
A function can operate on different types of objects.

#### Examples:

- Method Overriding:
```
# Parent Class
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal makes a sound."

# Child Class
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Dog barks."

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Cat meows."
```

- Duck Typing:
```
class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Dog barks."

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Cat meows."

class Bird:
    def speak(self):
        return "Bird chirps."

# Function demonstrating polymorphism
def make_animal_speak(animal):
    print(animal.speak())
```

- Operator Overloading
```
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"({self.x}, {self.y})"
```

- Function Polymorphism

```
# Polymorphic Function
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(5, 3)) # Output: 8 (integer addition)
print(add("Hello, ", "World!")) # Output: Hello, World! (string concatenation)
print(add([1, 2], [3, 4])) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (list concatenation)

```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). Encapsulation also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which helps in:

- Protecting data from unauthorized access or modification.
- Controlling how data and methods are accessed or modified.

#### Access Modifiers

- Python uses conventions (not strict enforcement) to denote access levels:
    - Public: Accessible from anywhere. (variable_name)
    - Protected: Accessible within the class and its subclasses. (_variable_name)
    - Private: Accessible only within the class. (__variable_name)

- Getter and Setter methods are used to access and modify private attributes while maintaining control and validation.

#### Example

```
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.__name = name     # Private attribute
        self.__salary = salary # Private attribute

    # Getter for __name
    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    # Setter for __name
    def set_name(self, name):
        self.__name = name

    # Getter for __salary
    def get_salary(self):
        return self.__salary

    # Setter for __salary
    def set_salary(self, salary):
        if salary > 0:
            self.__salary = salary
        else:
            raise ValueError("Salary must be positive")

```
