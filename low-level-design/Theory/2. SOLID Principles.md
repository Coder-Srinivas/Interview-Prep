## SOLID Design Principles

S - Single Responsibility Principle
O - Open Closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependecy Inversion Principle


### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

Any class should have just one responsibility or job. This means that every class, module, or function should have one specific responsibility or job. If a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes tightly coupled, making it harder to modify and maintain.

#### Example without SRP:

```
class UserManager:
    def create_user(self, name, email):
        # Code to create a user
        print(f"User {name} created.")

    def send_email(self, email):
        # Code to send an email
        print(f"Email sent to {email}.")
```

#### Example with SRP:

```
class UserManager:
    def create_user(self, name, email):
        # Code to create a user
        print(f"User {name} created.")

class EmailService:
    def send_email(self, email):
        # Code to send an email
        print(f"Email sent to {email}.")
```


#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Software entities(classes, functions, etc.) should be open for extention, but closed for modification.

This means:

- You should be able to add new functionality to a class or module without modifying its existing code.

- Protect existing behavior from being inadvertently changed or broken when new features are added.

#### Example without OCP:

```
class Discount:
    def calculate(self, amount, customer_type):
        if customer_type == "regular":
            return amount * 0.9
        elif customer_type == "vip":
            return amount * 0.8
        else:
            return amount
```

#### Example with OCP:

```
class Discount:
    def calculate(self, amount):
        return amount

class RegularDiscount(Discount):
    def calculate(self, amount):
        return amount * 0.9

class VIPDiscount(Discount):
    def calculate(self, amount):
        return amount * 0.8

# Usage
def get_discounted_price(discount, amount):
    return discount.calculate(amount)

# Example Usage
regular_discount = RegularDiscount()
vip_discount = VIPDiscount()

print(get_discounted_price(regular_discount, 100))  # Output: 90.0
print(get_discounted_price(vip_discount, 100))     # Output: 80.0
```

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of it's subclasses without altering the behaviour of the program. This means that a subclass should behave in such a way that it can seamlessly replace its parent class without altering the desired behavior of the program.

#### Example without LSP

```
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        return "Flying high"

class Penguin(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        raise Exception("Penguins can't fly")

# Usage
def make_bird_fly(bird):
    print(bird.fly())

penguin = Penguin()
make_bird_fly(penguin)
```

#### Example with LSP

```
class Bird:
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Chirp"

class FlyingBird(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        return "Flying high"

class Penguin(Bird):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Squawk"

# Usage
def make_bird_sound(bird):
    print(bird.make_sound())

# Example
sparrow = FlyingBird()
penguin = Penguin()

make_bird_sound(sparrow)  # Output: Chirp
make_bird_sound(penguin)  # Output: Squawk
```

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use, i.e split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones. This means:

- Design small, specific interfaces tailored to the needs of different clients rather than a large, general-purpose interface.
- Avoid "fat" or "bloated" interfaces where clients are forced to implement methods they don't need.

#### Examples violating ISP

```
class Machine:
    def print(self, document):
        pass

    def scan(self, document):
        pass

    def fax(self, document):
        pass

# OldPrinter implements the Machine interface
class OldPrinter(Machine):
    def print(self, document):
        print(f"Printing: {document}")

    def scan(self, document):
        raise NotImplementedError("Scan not supported")

    def fax(self, document):
        raise NotImplementedError("Fax not supported")

```

#### Example of ISP

```
class Printer:
    def print(self, document):
        pass

class Scanner:
    def scan(self, document):
        pass

class Fax:
    def fax(self, document):
        pass

# OldPrinter implements only the Printer interface
class OldPrinter(Printer):
    def print(self, document):
        print(f"Printing: {document}")

# MultiFunctionPrinter implements all interfaces
class MultiFunctionPrinter(Printer, Scanner, Fax):
    def print(self, document):
        print(f"Printing: {document}")

    def scan(self, document):
        print(f"Scanning: {document}")

    def fax(self, document):
        print(f"Faxing: {document}")

# Usage
printer = OldPrinter()
printer.print("Hello World")  # Works

mfp = MultiFunctionPrinter()
mfp.print("Hello World")      # Works
mfp.scan("Hello World")       # Works
mfp.fax("Hello World")        # Works

```
### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

#### Example violating DIP

```
class FileLogger:
    def log(self, message):
        with open("log.txt", "a") as file:
            file.write(message + "\n")

class Application:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = FileLogger()

    def run(self):
        self.logger.log("Application started")
        print("Application is running")
```

#### Example of DIP

```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstraction
class LoggerInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def log(self, message):
        pass

# Low-Level Module: FileLogger
class FileLogger(LoggerInterface):
    def log(self, message):
        with open("log.txt", "a") as file:
            file.write(message + "\n")

# Low-Level Module: ConsoleLogger
class ConsoleLogger(LoggerInterface):
    def log(self, message):
        print(f"Log: {message}")

# High-Level Module: Application
class Application:
    def __init__(self, logger: LoggerInterface):
        self.logger = logger

    def run(self):
        self.logger.log("Application started")
        print("Application is running")

# Usage
file_logger = FileLogger()
console_logger = ConsoleLogger()

app1 = Application(file_logger)
app1.run()

app2 = Application(console_logger)
app2.run()
```
